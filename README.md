# Python-print-styles
Welcome to the Python Print Style library!
This is just a simple but powerfull python library to help you color and style your font while using the console.
Using this library you can:
  - Set the font color
  - Set the background color
  - Set the font style

The library is as is, so unless there are any major changes that should be done, it will remine like it is from now on.
